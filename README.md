# Indoor-Positioning-with-WiFi
In this project, the WiFi-based RSS approach was employed to model positioning in an indoor environment. In particular, the RSSI lateration method was studied and experimented with to find the positioning. To optimize the path loss exponent (nsf), the study proposed to choose different nsf for each Access point (AP) rather than using a single value for all APs. The project also demonstrated how an increase in the number of APs led to multiple combinations and therefore resulted in more accurate results. The LOS and NLOS effects in the measurements were observed and measured during the project. For regions with less than three available APs, an intuitive solution for these regions was proposed.
